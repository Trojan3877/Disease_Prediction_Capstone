# 🔐 SECURITY POLICY  
Diabetes Prediction System  
Author: Corey Leath  
GitHub: https://github.com/Trojan3877

This document outlines the security standards, data protections, and responsible-use practices required for all contributors and users of this machine learning system.  
This project integrates **ML models, LLM reasoning, RAG retrieval, FastAPI endpoints, Dockerized services, and GitHub Actions**, so maintaining security is essential.

---

# ⚠️ 1. Responsible Use Disclaimer

This project is for **educational and research purposes only**.  
It **must not** be used to make real clinical decisions without:

- FDA approval  
- Licensed medical oversight  
- Proper data governance and validation  
- Model bias audits  

LLMs used in RAG explanations **are not medical professionals** and must not provide clinical advice.

---

# 🔒 2. Protected Health Data (PHI) & HIPAA Considerations

Although the dataset used here is synthetic, contributors MUST follow PHI handling protocols:

### ❌ Never Commit:
- Real patient data  
- Identifiable health information  
- FAISS indexes containing private documents  
- Model artifacts trained on sensitive datasets  
- API keys or environment variables  

### ✔ Always Ensure:
- All training data is non-sensitive or synthetic  
- File paths do not expose user identities  
- Model predictions are stored **only in memory**, not on disk  

---

# 🧪 3. LLM + RAG Safety Requirements

### LLM safeguards:
- No medical instructions  
- No diagnosis  
- No prescription suggestions  
- All LLM messages must include a disclaimer  

### RAG safeguards:
- Only professionally verified documents should be in the vector store  
- Do not embed:
  - copyrighted texts without permission  
  - personal health documents  
  - user-uploaded PDFs containing private data  

### Example required disclaimer:  
> “This explanation is generated by an AI system and is for educational purposes only. It is **not medical advice**.”

---

# 🛡 4. API Security (FastAPI)

### Required protections:
- Validate all inputs using **Pydantic models**  
- Reject malformed JSON  
- Rate-limit endpoints in production  
- Use HTTPS in deployed environments  
- Add CORS restrictions to allowed domains only  

### Never return:
- Stack traces  
- Internal directory paths  
- Raw model outputs that could leak structure  

---

# 🔑 5. Secret Management

This project uses `.env` files for:

- OpenAI keys  
- Hugging Face tokens  
- JWT secrets  
- Database URLs (if added later)  

### ❌ Do NOT commit `.env` files.

Already protected inside `.gitignore`.

### Production guidelines:
- Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD  
- Use Docker build arguments for tokens  
- Never hard-code keys in scripts  

---

# 📦 6. Docker + Deployment Security

### Required:
- Use non-root user inside Docker containers  
- Do not expose unnecessary ports  
- Keep Python and package versions up to date  
- Run Snyk or Trivy container scans before deployment  

### Optional (for enterprise systems):
- Sign containers (Sigstore / Cosign)  
- Enable image provenance tracking  

---

# 🧰 7. Dependencies & Supply Chain Security

### Requirements:
- Pin exact package versions in `requirements.txt`  
- Run vulnerability scans weekly  
- Only use reputable ML libraries:
  - Scikit-Learn  
  - XGBoost  
  - LightGBM  
  - FastAPI  
  - pydantic  
  - numpy/pandas  
  - OpenAI/HuggingFace  

### Do NOT install:
- Unknown GitHub repos  
- Unverified pip packages  
- Browser-executed JS inside FastAPI  

---

# 🧪 8. CI/CD Pipeline Security (GitHub Actions)

The GitHub Actions workflow must:
- Use **read-only tokens** whenever possible  
- Not print secrets in logs  
- Run dependency checks  
- Scan for hardcoded secrets  
- Build Docker securely  
- Run tests before deployment  

---

# 👤 9. Contributor Access Rules

Anyone submitting PRs must confirm they have NOT introduced:

- Personal health information  
- Proprietary documents  
- Medical advice from LLMs  
- API keys  

PRs violating this rule will be closed.

---

# 🛑 10. Reporting Vulnerabilities

To report a vulnerability:

1. Open a **private security issue**  
2. Or email the repository owner:  
   **Corey22blue@hotmail.com**  

Include:
- Description of issue  
- Steps to reproduce  
- Severity level  
- Proposed fix  

DO NOT publicly disclose vulnerabilities before resolution.

---

# 🎯 11. Final Notes

Security is not an optional feature — it is a **requirement** in all ML and software systems.  
Following this policy ensures the project remains:

- Safe  
- Compliant  
- Professional  
- Ready for Big Tech evaluation
